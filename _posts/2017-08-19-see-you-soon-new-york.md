Hello there!, In the last time I has been working hard and coding like a crazy, for this reason I had limited time to write.
I think that in the last months I improved a lot my programming skills and the way I'm resolving problems. Many thanks to Nick Sedlet and Roberto Thais for the opportunity to work with you. (I has been working in a really awesome startup based into New York).

I hope to work again with you in the future. From now, I will go to dedicate to improve myself and exceed his current level.
