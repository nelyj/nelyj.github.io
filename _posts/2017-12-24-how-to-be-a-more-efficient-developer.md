Hello world!, I has been working in many task, projects, so on. For this reason, for me, it's important to schedule my
task and put my thoughts in order. If you want to be a really good developer is neccesary to achieve this points:

- Deadlines: If you set a deadline, you need to work hard to hit them. If you can't make them, it MUST neccesaries to notify in advance if you can't make the deadline.
- Agreeing on actions: When you are understanding the problem to solve, its MUST neccesaries to set a to-do items list. If you can't understand all the problem you could to record the conversation.
- Being absent: Its really important for your [client, employer, whatever] know that you are working (doing), for this reason you NEVER had to lose communication. Life-Hack: You can schedule emails and slack messages ;).
- Communication: In the best case, you always need an internet connection, for any emergency, call, so on. Remember that the best developers has a really good communication skill and the facility to work in any place.
- Productivity: If you can accomplish of the above points, you will a more efficient developer.
